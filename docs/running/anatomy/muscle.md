## Muscle Fibers for Endurance Runners

Obviously, the most important muscle fiber type for endurance runners is Slow switch fiber (type I, or Slow oxidative). It is fatigue resistent and very energy efficient.

## Adaptation

The FOG (intermediate) muscle fiber can be converted to slow or fast switch muscle fiber depending on the needs and adapatation.

In fact, adaptation can even slowly convert between all three types of fibers (maybe in years).
