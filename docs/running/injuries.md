## Overall Approach

Honestly, I have been many injuries myself, and my approach is always to put my body's message before everything else.

* Stop at any median level discomfort
* Test, diagonize, evaluation before return to normal training
* Be sensitive
* Monitor body's condition, and adjust training according
  * e.g., resting heart rate is a great indication of overall body condition
* fit in cross/strength training into the training plan
* **Strong runners** are much less likely to get injuries. So don't be afraid of weight training.


## Top Concern

For any runner, injury prevention should be the top priority!

This is not only for general health concern. Injury is probably the top factor that impacts runners' performance and training.

## Causes

### Training error  

Over-training andd insufficient recovery probably contributed to majority of runners' injury.

Remediations:

* Start with a good plan
* Listen to your body's recovery – adjust frequently while keep the big goal. Let go the ego.
* Stick to a "dynamic" plan – don't over train within the plan

### Flexibility

This is can be  controversial. In general, inflexibility increases the chance of injury, but often not the direct cause.

Remediations:

* More warm-up/cool-down (note, DO NOT over-do it)
* stretching
* Cross training  
* Also, improve muscle balance

#### Strength and flexibility

Interestingly, strength and flexibility is naturally conflicting in our body. A heavily trained muscle group is often stiff, which is human body's way to improve its strength.

Stretching, which is believed to improve flexibility, also reduces the body's effort to make the muscle stronger.

You will need to find a balance in pursuing the two - strength vs flexibility.

### Muscle imbalance

Muscle imbalance often leads to muscle fatigue during training, which increases the chance of injury.

Remediations:

1. Cross training
1. Drills
1. Improve flexibility

### Bad form

It is challenging to change the forms by oneself. Interesting, pros also have various forms if you observe carefully. It is not saying forms are not important. Rather, human body's great adaptation over one's life time can make everyone's form specific to itself.

Remediations:

* Try gradual change, do not force dramatic changes
* Drillls
* Self video taping

### Footwear

It might be the hottest topic everyone cares. But, I don't believe too much in the shoes' mysterious mileage limit. I'd rather pay attention to how it feels on my feet everyday.
