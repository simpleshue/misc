## Overall Approach

Honestly, I have been many injuries myself, and my approach is always to put my body's message before everything else.

1. Be sensitive and cautious
    * Stop at any median level discomfort
    * Test, diagonize, evaluation before return to normal training
    * Be sensitive
1. Short-term
    * Fix the symptom/pain through rest (or/and anti-inflammation drugs with professional instruction).
    * Inspect and fix external factors, such as shoes.
    * If it is related to over-training, adjust training plan.
    * Use equipments to reduce the pain and help body to heal.
1. Long-term
    * Identify the root cause (e.g., bad forms, muscle imbalance/inflexibility/weakness).
    * Fit in cross training with focus on mitigating the root cause (e.g., strength/stability training, stretching).
        * **Strong runners** are much less likely to get injuries. So don't be afraid of weight training.
    * Consider more warm-up/cool-down, and/or active recovery (e.g., massage/icing).
    * Consult professional (e.g. physical therapist)

## Top Concern

For any runner, injury prevention should be the top priority!

This is not only for general health concern. Injury is probably the top factor that impacts runners' performance and training.

## Causes

### Training error  

Over-training andd insufficient recovery probably contributed to majority of runners' injury.

Remediations:

* Start with a good plan
* Listen to your body's recovery – adjust frequently while keep the big goal. Let go the ego.
* Stick to a "dynamic" plan – don't over train within the plan

### Flexibility

This is can be  controversial. In general, inflexibility increases the chance of injury, but often not the direct cause.

Remediations:

* More warm-up/cool-down (note, DO NOT over-do it)
* stretching
* Cross training  
* Also, improve muscle balance

#### Strength and flexibility

Interestingly, strength and flexibility is naturally conflicting in our body. A heavily trained muscle group is often stiff, which is human body's way to improve its strength.

Stretching, which is believed to improve flexibility, also reduces the body's effort to make the muscle stronger.

You will need to find a balance in pursuing the two - strength vs flexibility.

### Muscle imbalance

Muscle imbalance often leads to muscle fatigue during training, which increases the chance of injury.

Remediations:

1. Cross training
1. Drills
1. Improve flexibility

### Bad form

It is challenging to change the forms by oneself. Interesting, pros also have various forms if you observe carefully. It is not saying forms are not important. Rather, human body's great adaptation over one's life time can make everyone's form specific to itself.

Remediations:

* Try gradual change, do not force dramatic changes
* Drillls
* Self video taping

### Footwear

It might be the hottest topic everyone cares. But, I don't believe too much in the shoes' mysterious mileage limit. I'd rather pay attention to how it feels on my feet everyday.

## Common Injuries

> Disclaimer - I am not a professional physical therapist. Rather, I am just sharing what I learned over my research and personal experiences.

### Plantar Fasciitis (PF)

PF is a common injury typically in a form of pain in the heel, or bottom of the heel. Often it is the worst in the morning with the first few steps. It is related to overuse of the plantar fascia. That is, **feet* are used too much, so that the fascia is used to compensate in place of muscles.

As for treatments, short-term is often to reduce pain and let it heal, while maintain the muscle groups that should have taken the load instead of the fascia. The long-term solution is to progress training slowly while keep the muscle groups *strong*.

[Treatment of Plantar Fasciitis](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2001/0201/p467.html/1000) is so far the best reference I have found.

High level

1. Identify training errors - Relative rest, apply ice after training and evaluatoin of shoes.
    * Shoes - to reduce the load on feet
        * Change for wider/larger shoes
        * Better cushioned midsole
1. Correct biomechnical factors with stretching and strengthening.
    * Stretching - calves
    * Strengthening  
        * Towel curl

        ![towel curl]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/running/injury_towel_stretching.jpg)

        * Toe taps
        * Picking up some objects with toes.
        * (Preventative) [More calves exercise](https://simpleshue.github.io/misc/docs/running/strength_training/#calves).
1. Running forms
    * Land softly reduces the stress.
    * Avoid excessive landing on toes or balls.
1. If no improvement, consider night splints and orthotics.
    * Equipment
        * Arch support and orthotics
        * Night splints
1. If still no improvement, check if professionals for more serioues treatment.
    * Drugs (short term)
        * anti-inflammatory drugs – results unclear. Ok for short term pain relief.
        * Ice 10-15min might help
    * Other serious treatments, e.g., corticosteroid injections, surgery.

### Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS)

Symptom - Often pain at hip or outside of the knee.

Causes - irritated iliotibial band (ITB). Often the tightened ITB will cut into the knee, which causes the pain there.

Treatments are similar to PF

1. Rest to reduce the on-going pain and inflammation.
1. Apply ice or other therapy to speed up recovery.
1. Stretch
1. Strengthen muscle groups in glute and thigh (e.g., quad, hamstring).
1. Improve balance

### Achilles Tendon Injuries

Causes - the common cause is over-use. 

#### Treatment

Note, tendon heals very slowly. The way our body heals is to lay down new fibers. However, such newly formed layers can be damaged by excess stretching. 

To avoid it, pay special attention to calf stretching/strengthening exercises. You can replace stretching calves with foam roller, or massage.

Avoid low-heel (or low drop) shoes to reduce load on the tendon. Some amount of cushion can be considered as well.


## A Note on Rest

It is a bit contraversial that lying-flat kind of rest is not suggested, since it reduce the muscle and other performance ability quickly, which may not idea for overcoming the symptoms. Rather, controlled exercise is often suggested.

Depending on the severity of the condition, the pain may kick in only after certain distance (e.g. 2 mile of running). So try to run in a moderate pace and stop before 2 miles. You can repeat after some rest. This kind of run-and-rest will allow the muscles some time to rest and recovery, while still being stimulated to perform. Note, don't push it too hard, and it may reduce the speed of recovery.

Another suggestion is to consider other (hopefully related) sports, that can maintain physical conditions while reduce the load on the particular area (foot in this case). So things like cycling and rolling are good options. Actually, many runner may find symptom reduced by simply running on threadmills or rubber running tracks, where the extra cusion from the ground reduces shocks to the feet.
