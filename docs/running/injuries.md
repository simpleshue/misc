## Overall Approach

Honestly, I have been many injuries myself, and my approach is always to put my body's message before everything else.

* Stop at any median level discomfort
* Test, diagonize, evaluation before return to normal training
* Be sensitive
* Monitor body's condition, and adjust training according
  * e.g., resting heart rate is a great indication of overall body condition
* fit in cross/strength training into the training plan
* **Strong runners** are much less likely to get injuries. So don't be afraid of weight training.

## Top Concern

For any runner, injury prevention should be the top priority!

This is not only for general health concern. Injury is probably the top factor that impacts runners' performance and training.

## Causes

### Training error  

Over-training andd insufficient recovery probably contributed to majority of runners' injury.

Remediations:

* Start with a good plan
* Listen to your body's recovery – adjust frequently while keep the big goal. Let go the ego.
* Stick to a "dynamic" plan – don't over train within the plan

### Flexibility

This is can be  controversial. In general, inflexibility increases the chance of injury, but often not the direct cause.

Remediations:

* More warm-up/cool-down (note, DO NOT over-do it)
* stretching
* Cross training  
* Also, improve muscle balance

#### Strength and flexibility

Interestingly, strength and flexibility is naturally conflicting in our body. A heavily trained muscle group is often stiff, which is human body's way to improve its strength.

Stretching, which is believed to improve flexibility, also reduces the body's effort to make the muscle stronger.

You will need to find a balance in pursuing the two - strength vs flexibility.

### Muscle imbalance

Muscle imbalance often leads to muscle fatigue during training, which increases the chance of injury.

Remediations:

1. Cross training
1. Drills
1. Improve flexibility

### Bad form

It is challenging to change the forms by oneself. Interesting, pros also have various forms if you observe carefully. It is not saying forms are not important. Rather, human body's great adaptation over one's life time can make everyone's form specific to itself.

Remediations:

* Try gradual change, do not force dramatic changes
* Drillls
* Self video taping

### Footwear

It might be the hottest topic everyone cares. But, I don't believe too much in the shoes' mysterious mileage limit. I'd rather pay attention to how it feels on my feet everyday.

### Plantar Fasciitis

[Treatment of Plantar Fasciitis](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2001/0201/p467.html/1000) is so far the best reference I have found.

High level

1. Identify training errors - Relative rest, apply ice after training and evaluatoin of shoes.
    * Shoes - to reduce the load on feet
        * Change for wider/larger shoes
        * Better cushioned midsole
1. Correct biomechnical factors with stretching and strengthening.
    * Stretching - calves
    * Strengthening  
        * Towel curl
        ![towel curl]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/running/injury_towel_stretching.png)
        * Toe taps
        * Picking up some objects with toes.
1. If no improvement, consider night splints and orthotics.
    * Equipment
        * Arch support and orthotics
        * Night splints
1. If still no improvement, check if professionals for more serioues treatment.
    * Drugs (short term)
        * anti-inflammatory drugs – results unclear. Ok for short term pain relief.
        * Ice 10-15min might help
    * Other serious treatments, e.g., corticosteroid injections, surgery.

### A Note on Rest

It is a bit contraversial that lying-flat kind of rest is not suggested, since it reduce the muscle and other performance ability quickly, which may not idea for overcoming the symptoms. Rather, controlled exercise is often suggested. 

Depending on the severity of the condition, the pain may kick in only after certain distance (e.g. 2 mile of running). So try to run in a moderate pace and stop before 2 miles. You can repeat after some rest. This kind of run-and-rest will allow the muscles some time to rest and recovery, while still being stimulated to perform. Note, don't push it too hard, and it may reduce the speed of recovery.

Another suggestion is to consider other (hopefully related) sports, that can maintain physical conditions while reduce the load on the particular area (foot in this case). So things like cycling and rolling are good options. Actually, many runner may find symptom reduced by simply running on threadmills or rubber running tracks, where the extra cusion from the ground reduces shocks to the feet.
