Changing running forms is always risky. Imagine your body as a system running for many years. Every muscle, tendon and all everything has been adjusted over the years, changing how they work together always imposes  risk.

If you want to try changing the forms to archieve better performance, do it with caution and only make minor/mild change very slowly. For performance purpose, spending extra time increasing the workout may also bring similar benefit without the risk of injuery.

The only one case I would suggest considering the change is that you got injuried or discomfort in running, and have confirmed that the form to be one of the factors. Hence, `No Break, No Fix`. Even then, there can be more then one factor, and changing running forms might not necessarily be on the top of the list. I would suggest start with stability and strength training, or even a professional diagnosis.
