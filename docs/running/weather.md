## Run in the Heat

## Run in the Cold

### Protection

Keeping the body warm from the cold is always the top priority. Weather can be unpredictable and poses risk to health and life.

Overall, similar to many other outdoor sports:

1. Layers - so that you can adjust when necessary. Generally, one wants to dress 15-20 degrees warmer than the actual temperature. Also, also pay attention to wind, which can take away heat from the body easily.
1. Hat - a hat is almost a necessity in winter.
1. Gloves - do not be afraid to wear heavy gloves. One's hands/warms are less active, so sometimes heavy gloves (e.g. ski gloves) can be helpful.
1. Masks/neck gaiters - less popular, but definitely helps a lot in extremely cold weather.
1. Shoes - given one's feet are very active, they generally need less protection fron the cold. However, many sole material can behave differently (stiff, grips), plus icy road increases the risk of slipping.

### Safety

Daylight is much shorter in many places, so make youself visible by wearing reflectives, or flashing lights for safety. It is even helpful to bring a headlamp.

### Hydration

Our body is often less sensitive to thirsty during cold weather. That does not mean it needs less. Still pay attention to hydration.

### More Warm-Up

This one is probably obvious. Being cold outside, we will need more time to warm up.
