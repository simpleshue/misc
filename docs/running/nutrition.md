## Fueling

Generally, activities shorter than 90 minutes do not require additional fueling.

### Before the RaceDay

[The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705) currently recommends that you consume 8 to 12 grams per kilogram of body weight of carbohydrate per day in the two to three days prior to their event, while resting or significantly dialing back their training.

### On the Race Day

On the race day, it suggests targeting 2 to 4 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight two to four hours prior to your race. (some also recommended 0.5 gram for per pound, whic his effectively 1 gram per kg).

Then, 15 minutes before the start, eat either a couple Medjool dates or a gel.

Generally, multi-day carb loading isn't necessary for training. But long-runs can be a perfect opportunity to practice race-day carb loading to make sure your body is comfortable with the type of food and schedule.

The infamous "wall" describes the depletion of carb reserve, which is often observed in marathon runners in the last 6.2-mile (out of the total 26.2 miles). [^1] suggests that top form human body can carry energy to perform as maximal aerobic capacity for 90-120 minutes, though practically it is never close. As a result, continuous fueling during the race has been critical for the elites.

However, our body has limited intake capacity, especially during race where water is a limited resource. So typically, smaller and frequent feeding is preferred, while keeping the body hydrated is also crucial.

Note, carb intake typically has little impact of the first 60-minute performance, while it also takes time for the fuel to reach the muscle.

[^1] provided a sample fueling/drinking schedule. Note that the latter stages of the race, however, have less focus on simple hydration.

### Tips

Don't swallow a gel all at once. Take time - e.g., between a quarter and one mile of running distance. Taka  a little of the gel at a time.

### Fat vs Carbohydrate

Fueling sources during endurance running is often split into fat and carbohydrate for simplicity.

The big differences are:

|             | Fat                                                                                                | Carbohydrate                                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utilization | Hard - only aerobically and requires more oxygen. <br>Slow - two times longer than carb metabolism | Easy, both aerobically and anaerobically                                                     |
| Reserve     | A lot  (up to ~2000h @ 60% VO2Max)                                                                 | Limited:  <br>Muscle glycogen can provide ~2h of energy <br>Liver stores ~20% of body's glycogen |
| Absorption  | Slow - almost impossible during a race                                                             | Quick - possible during a race                                                               |

The good news is our body can be trained to improve fat utilization (for example, by high fat diet, and/or exercise with low carb reserve). The bad news is that our carb efficiency may drop while doing that. Basically, the metabolism of the two sources compete with each other on limited resources such as oxygen, water, blood PH level and entry into mitochondria.

## Debate in Stress vs Performance (Fasted Training)

There is a debate that while training with low carb to improve fat efficiency, our body is likely not at its peak peroformance state. As a result, our body can't get as much as stimulus from the training. If we really want to push to train at  high level, a high risk of injury is another concern. For females, such training may impact worse hormone balance more[^2].

Nowadays, atheletes can get enough carb fueling during a race without much difficulty, so fat-efficiency oriented training is not that attractive for most people.

## Protein

Protein is often a neglected nutrition to runners.

### Recovery

Muscle can be broken down during exercise. Protein is vital to the recovery and sustaining a healthy immune system.

Like many body builders, [fellrnr](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Nutrient_Timing) referenced a recommendation of protein/carbohydrate mix immediately after exercise (e.g., within 40mins, with 15g of protein) - Note, I have never tested that.

However, protein is considered to be absorbed slowly, and a relatively large intake can be absorbed slowly. This is especially true for slower-acting protein sources. [This](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5828430/) sugguests a >20g protein per meal may result some protein being broken down instead of used to build/repair muscles, but there is still beneficial for muscle to have higher protein intake.

### fellrnr's Example

[fellrnr](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Nutrient_Timing) suggests 1:4 of protein to carbohydrate mix during exercise, though I have some suspicion about whether our digestion system can handle that during intense exercise.

It also provided an example routine, which consists of a very high protein schedule, with a 263g total protein intake. My guess is that is for a very heavy workout, though I suspect it also varies by person's digestion system.

### Absoption and Muscle synthesis

It was believed that 20-25g protein per meal is the max for muscle. Too much will be broken down. However, [some new study](https://physiqonomics.com/is-there-a-limit-to-how-much-protein-you-can-absorb-in-a-meal/) suggests a large protein intake (100g) can benefit muscle synthesis in the next 12 hours compared with only 4  hours with 25g protein intake.

So it may not be a big concern/waste to consume a large amount of protein at once.
