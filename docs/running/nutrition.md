## Fasted Running

Benefits:

* force body to increase fat consumption efficiency
* similar benefits as intermitted fasting

Concerns:

* lowers performance/training quality
* decrease muscle breakdown, worse hormone balance and metabolic disturbances, particularly for females

Conclusion - the slight benefit from improving fat consumption efficiency probably does not weigh as much as general health. Instead, always consider fueling your training, specially hard ones.
