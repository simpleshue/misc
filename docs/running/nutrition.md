## Fueling

Generally, activities shorter than 90 minutes do not require additional fueling.

[The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705) currently recommends that you consume 8 to 12 grams per kilogram of body weight of carbohydrate per day in the two to three days prior to their event, while resting or significantly dialing back their training.

On the race day, it suggests targeting 2 to 4 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight two to four hours prior to your race.

Then, 15 minutes before the start, eat either a couple Medjool dates or a gel.

Generally, multi-day carb loading isn't necessary for training. But long-runs can be a perfect opportunity to practice race-day carb loading to make sure your body is comfortable with the type of food and schedule.

The infamous "wall" describes the depletion of carb reserve, which is often observed in marathon runners in the last 6.2-mile (out of the total 26.2 miles). [^1] suggests that top form human body can carry energy to perform as maximal aerobic capacity for 90-120 minutes, though practically it is never close. As a result, continuous fueling during the race has been critical for the elites.

However, our body has limited intake capacity, especially during race where water is a limited resource. So typically, smaller and frequent feeding is preferred, while keeping the body hydrated is also crucial.

Note, carb intake typically has little impact of the first 60-minute performance, while it also takes time for the fuel to reach the muscle.

[^1] provided a sample fueling/drinking schedule. Note that the latter stages of the race, however, have less focus on simple hydration.

### Fat vs Carbohydrate

Fueling sources during endurance running is often split into fat and carbohydrate for simplicity.

The big differences are:

|             | Fat                                                                                                | Carbohydrate                                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utilization | Hard - only aerobically and requires more oxygen. <br>Slow - two times longer than carb metabolism | Easy, both aerobically and anaerobically                                                     |
| Reserve     | A lot  (up to ~2000h @ 60% VO2Max)                                                                 | Limited:  <br>Muscle glycogen can provide ~2h of energy <br>Liver stores ~20% of body's glycogen |
| Absorption  | Slow - almost impossible during a race                                                             | Quick - possible during a race                                                               |

The good news is our body can be trained to improve fat utilization (for example, by high fat diet, and/or exercise with low carb reserve). The bad news is that our carb efficiency may drop while doing that. Basically, the metabolism of the two sources compete with each other on limited resources such as oxygen, water, blood PH level and entry into mitochondria.

## Debate in Stress vs Performance (Fasted Training)

There is a debate that while training with low carb to improve fat efficiency, our body is likely not at its peak peroformance state. As a result, our body can't get as much as stimulus from the training. If we really want to push to train at  high level, a high risk of injury is another concern. For females, such training may impact worse hormone balance more[^2].

Nowadays, atheletes can get enough carb fueling during a race without much difficulty, so fat-efficiency oriented training is not that attractive for most people.
