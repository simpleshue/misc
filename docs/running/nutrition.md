## Fasted Running

Benefits:

* force body to increase fat consumption efficiency
* similar benefits as intermitted fasting

Concerns:

* lowers performance/training quality
* decrease muscle breakdown, worse hormone balance and metabolic disturbances, particularly for females

Conclusion - the slight benefit from improving fat consumption efficiency probably does not weigh as much as general health. Instead, always consider fueling your training, specially hard ones.

## Fueling

* Generally, activities shorter than 90 minutes do not require additional fueling.

[The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705) currently recommends that you consume 8 to 12 grams per kilogram of body weight of carbohydrate per day in the two to three days prior to their event, while resting or significantly dialing back their training.

On the race day, it suggests targeting 2 to 4 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight two to four hours prior to your race.

Then, 15 minutes before the start, eat either a couple Medjool dates or a gel.

Generally, multi-day carb loading isn't necessary for training. But long-runs can be a perfect opportunity to practice race-day carb loading to make sure your body is comfortable with the type of food and schedule.
