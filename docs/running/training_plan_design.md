## Initial Things to consider

1. Commitment
1. Goal (distance, speed)
1. Current status (training, injury, general health condition)

## Progressive Overloading

Here we separate it into two: *Progressive* and *Overload*.

### Progressive

*Progressive* means to increase training duration/instance/intensity gradually. The so called 10%-weekly-increase rule is a rule of thumb for many.

Just be aware, if you stopped training for a certain period, you may need to re-consider where to pick it up. Some general concensus below:

* Miss 1-3 days - resume training as before.
* Miss 4-7 days, need 1-4 days of easy run before trying faster/longer runs.
* Miss >1 week, spend equal amount of days doing easy runs.
* Miss > 1 month, back to base.

### Overaload

Overload is the mechanism that pushes your body out of the comfort zone, so that it understands that it needs to be more powerful or more efficient in order to handle such stress. It is how our body improve our performance.

If not enough stimulation, then performance improvement can be slow, if any. This is because the body's current fitness level can perfect handle the training, so there is no need for human body to change.

We can overload by:

* applying more load. E.g., longer distance, faster pace.
* changing schedules. E.g., vary speed or distance for interval/tempo.
* changing course. E.g., replace some speed run with hill runs, or trail runs.
* simulate different muscle groups for strength training.

All above are examples to bring the training out of the regular comfort zone.

Just be aware, *overload* is a double-edged sword. It needs to be controlled to be *progressive*, otherwise, it is an invite for over-training.

## Recovery

Recovery is the time to harvest the positive results from hard workout. With progressive training, your body is in a micro-"broken" state, where good recovery can over-compensate.

We want to fully harvest such over-compensation through recovery. Many people only reconganized the training aspect, because that is the part require active engagement. However, the passive recovery is when the benefits happens.

There are many indicators you can use to guide the recovery.

* general tiredness
* wake-up [resting heart rate](../heart_rate/#resting-heart-rate)
* HRV - it is a new popular indicator. However, you should only compare it with your own recent history, since the metric can be contraversial when comparing with others, with different calculators, or even with distant history.
* muscle soreness
* heart rate during warmup

Overally, I would put one's self assessed recovery more than the training plan. Adjustment should be made if your body tells you to rest!

### Active recovery

During a long (macro) cycle, a rest period (usually a week) is often introduced between two meso cycles (2-6 weeks). It allows the body to fully recover to take on new training.

## Cycles

Training is better done in cycles with **Progressive overloading** and **recovery**.

* Macro cycles - 16-26 weeks. Full cycle
  * Typically consists of multiple meso cycles. E.g., base --> tempo --> interval.
* Meso cycles - 2-6 weeks
  * Based on dody adaptation cycles - **one focus at a time to avoid over-training**
  * Overload → then may need recovery in between - cut-back 25-50% volume (need deload by the end of the meso cycle)
* Micro cycles - 1 week
  * 2-4 “effort” workouts per week - to avoid over training. Allow sufficient recovery.

## Mentality

Not only your body, your brain also needs to be able to handle stressful and long running sessions.

Different training types serves different purposes

1. Long run teaches the brain to handle long duration, while keep the mental and physical body stimulated. It is often the most important type of training for novice distance runners.
1. Tempo run teaches the brain to understand body's limit during prolonged highly stressful exercies.
1. Interval teaches the brain the top speed it can handle, and for how long.

Overall, training is teaching the brain to understand the limits of the body, so that it can handle different situations to achieve good performance.

A good habbit to reinforce the mental training is to keep running logs.

## Top Priority - injury free

Overall, injury prevention should be on top of the list.

## Priority list

1. Injuery free / General health
    * Rest
    * Nutrition
1. Base
    * Base of everything related to running.
    * Distance, speed, stability, flexibility, strength.
    * Efficiency
    * Forms
1. Speed training - often race specific
1. Mentality
