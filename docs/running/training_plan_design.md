## Initial Things to consider

1. Commitment
1. Goal (distance, speed)
1. Current status (training, injury, general health condition)

## Cycles

Training is better done in cycles with **Progressive overloading** and **recovery**.

* Macro cycles - 16-26 weeks. Full cycle
  * Typically consists of multiple meso cycles. E.g., base --> tempo --> interval.
* Meso cycles - 2-6 weeks
  * Based on dody adaptation cycles - one focus at a time to avoid over-training
  * Overload → then may need recovery in between - cut-back 25-50% volume (need deload by the end of the meso cycle)
* Micro cycles - 1 week
  * 2-4 “effort” workouts per week - to avoid over training. Allow sufficient recovery.

## Top Priority - injury free

Overall, injury prevention should be on top of the list.
