Heart rate is probably the most accessible statistics for most runners.

## Max and Resting Heart Rate

Before using it to guide your workout, first, we need to understand the basics, max and resting (min) heart rates.

### Mysterious max heart rate formulas

There are many formulas to predict one's max heart rate. To name a few

* Haskell & Fox(1971): `200 - age`
* Tanaka, Monahan, & Seals (2001): `208 − (0.7 × age)`

These are all general predication based on a large number of samples. However, everyone is special. You might be surpised to see your HR to spike to 200 during an interval training. Some recent research suggests that human's max heart rate is close to 300!

To have a better estimate of your max HR. Professionally, it can be measured by increasing exercise intensity gradually until your heart has reached its max output (certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor).

A practical meassurement can be taken using 1-mile test:

1. Warmup 1-2 miles
1. Run one mile on a track at tempo pace. Run an all-out effort in the last 400 meters.
1. Sprint the last 100 meters as fast as possible.

Or, a more gradual test

1. Warm up by jogging for 10-15 minutes.
1. Run 1 mile at 10k or Lactate threshold pace.
1. Without stopping, increase your pace by 2 seconds every 200 meters until one can't keep increasing the pace.

The highest heart rate during the test can be used as the max heart rate.

### Resting heart rate

Resting heart rate is an indicator for one's general health. While being in the general range, relatively lower heart rate is considered to be a better physical condition (e.g., see the heart rate reserve below).

Resting heart rate can be measured easily. The easiest way is to measure it right after wake-up, while you are still laying flat.

With such as morning indicator, it gives you a general sense of one's overall physical condition, and one may want to adjust the training plan accordingly if the reading is higher as normal. For runners, it can give some indication on how well is the recovery to avoid over-training.

Personally, I would reduce or even avoid hard workout when the morning resting heart rate is abnormally high. (See [Patterns](#patterns) below for more discussion on how various factors can effect resting heart rate).

### Heart rate reserve

Heart rate reverse describes the room one can push during exercise. So, don't be sad when one find a high Max Heart Rate. It means you have higher capacity!

```
HR reserve = HR max − HR rest
```

### HRV

HRV is a recent popular statistics, *supported* by modern sport watches.

## Patterns

### Things That Increases Resting HR

* Heat
* Humidity
* Dehydration
* Hard/long workout
* Sickness
* Tireness
* Stress
* Alcohol

### Things That Decreases Resting HR

* Easy/Zone-2 run - faster pace (e.g., lactate threshold) running won't necessarily reduce HR.
* Good rest
