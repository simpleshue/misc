## By Area

### Calves

1. Calf walk - can serve as a warmup.
1. Heel walk - can serve as a warmup.
1. [Calf raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Kv6-fnTj8)
    * Single leg standing raise - consider dip the heal down slowly, and up quickly.
    * 15x3
    * Optional - with modrate weight
    * If having heel issue, avoid dipping below the toe level.
1. [Toe raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzIcGAgBiaM)
    * Lean back on the wall, whil keep body straight.
    * 10-15x3
1. Rope jump

### Quad, Hamstring & Glute

1. Squat
    * The most basic one. Engages multiple muscle group. It serves the base for all other leg exercises.
    * Down slowly, and up quickly
    * Optional - with  power up
    * Optional - with weight
1. Split leg lounge (Bulgaria)
    * Upper body lean forwawrd with a fix angle to focus on glute. If keep upper body straight, it will focus more on quads
    * 10-15x3
    * Optional - with weights
1. Single leg deadlift
    * 10-15x3
    * Free-holding and extend upper body and arms forward - improve balance.
1. [Lounge circuit](https://youtu.be/SnNlrFcXjVU?t=227)
    * 5-8 each side
1. Glute bridge
    * focus on hamstring
    * the farther away the lower foot, the more challenging it is.
1. Jumping on box
1. Nordic hamstring curl
    * great for hamstring
1. Hip flexion with bands
    * Similar to calf stretch when pushing towards a wall, use a rubber band while lifting the leg high.
    * Focus on Iliopsoas (髂腰肌) - for lifting thighs.

### Core

1. Plank - flat / side
1. [Side plank abductor hold](https://youtu.be/SnNlrFcXjVU?t=488)
    * Also improves inner muscle of the tighs

## Theory

[BEST Exercises for Runners](https://youtu.be/GcZJhNi2yOM?si=lOzsqXmWts7HvHCt) divided strength training into seveal aspects:

* Plyometrics
* Explosive reistance
* Strength

### Muscle for running fast

When running faster, the most demand longer strides comes from

* Glute
* Quads
* Calves

But the demand for faster cadence is from

* Hamstring – for lift lower legs
* Iliopsoas (髂腰肌) - for lifting thighs

Most training should probably be done for the raw strength, which builds the base. Explosive and swift aspects should also be practiced for both speed and safety.

Most training we have mentioned so far focus on raw strength. Now we mention a few for explosiveness and swiftness

### Explosiveness

Box jumps, and Explosive step-up are recommended in the video. To me, I believe interval training is also a good exercise, which is more natural to running.

### Swiftness

The video recommended various jumps. To add more, I believe jumping rope should be included. It is well regarded in various other sports.

Various other foot drills also helps to improve self-awareness of leg movement.

Trail running is also a very good way to keep your foot swift.

## Sample Training For Runners

1. General [warmps](warmup_cooldown.html) first.
1. (Start from large muscle groups) Squat/lounge
1. Calf/Toe raise
1. Plank - flat/side
1. Glute bridge
