Inspired by [Stephen Seiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNngp1u-Ls&t=1878s) and [fellrnr](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/How_To_Train), I was looking into how training can be specific, and what are trainable.


## Trainable Factors

* VO2Max - Aerobic capacity is on the top of the list. 
    * It consists of heart rate, stroke volume and oxygen concentration in blood. 
    * Out of the three,  typically only the stroke volume is trainable (stronger/bigger heart) to have a long lasting benefit (heart rate decreases with age. oxygen concentrain can temporarily increase with altitude adaptation, which is often short lived).
    * Its adaptation is typically achieved in weeks or months, and then becomes stable even with harder training.
    * Can be trained via High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
* Running economy
    * It can continue improve over time (many years).
    * It consists of [^1]:
        * metabolic adaptations within the muscle such as increased mitochondria and oxidative enzymes 
        * the ability of the muscles to store and release elastic energy by increasing the stiffness of the muscles 
        * more efficient mechanics leading to less energy wasted on braking forces and excessive vertical oscillation
    * Can be trained via
        * HIIT 
        * Explosive (plyometrics) or maximal strength training  
        * intermittent hypoxia (Breath control?) 
* Endurance 
    * Both skeletal and cardiac muscle endurance
    * Typically, eccentric load is the most harmful to skeletal muscles during fatigue, which should be emphasized.
    * Can be trained via
        * eccentric strength training
        * Long run
* Fractional utilization - how much O2 can be utilized  
* Heat/altitude adaptation

### Summary

The following forms of exercises offers specific benefits for running:

1. Long run - Endurance
1. HIIT - VO2Max, running economy
1. Strength training - running economy, endurance
1. Plyometrics - running economy
1. Hill run - can be considered as a combination of HIIT (uphill) and Strength training (downhill, focusing on eccentric load)

### A word on Tempo

Tempo refers to continuous running at a relatively high speed (e.g., Lactate threshold speed) for a considerable long distance (longer than intervals). It sits between long run and interval runs, which puts stress in multiple trainable factors. 

There is a lot of debate on effectiveness of tempo training. For professionals, extended tempo training means to sacrifice scarce resources (time, stress quote the body can take and recover from), which may lead to less-ideal performance improvement. On the other hand, polarized training approach is often preferred, where long run and HIIT are used as the main training types. The argument for polarized training is:

1. Long run at easy pace allow for fast recovery, while specifically targeted on training for endurance (e.g., higher volume).
1. HIIT also specifically targets running economy, and puts less stress on the body. It also allows the athletes to training more at the higher intensity.

For beginners though, tempo still offers training benefit. But it may also increase the risk of injuery. To make an analogy, tempo training is like those complex weight-lifting workout, which engages many muscle groups. While you can archieve many things at once, none of the muscles groups receives strong stimulus. While the weight increases, some weak-link may be put on too much stress, leading to injury. While some more specific exercise can be better controlled to avoid injury.
