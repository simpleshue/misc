Inspired by [Stephen Seiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otNngp1u-Ls&t=1878s) and [fellrnr](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/How_To_Train), I was looking into how training can be specific, and what are trainable.


## Trainable Factors

* VO2Max - Aerobic capacity is on the top of the list. 
    * It consists of heart rate, stroke volume and oxygen concentration in blood. 
    * Out of the three,  typically only the stroke volume is trainable (stronger/bigger heart) to have a long lasting benefit (heart rate decreases with age. oxygen concentrain can temporarily increase with altitude adaptation, which is often short lived).
    * Its adaptation is typically achieved in weeks or months, and then becomes stable even with harder training.
    * Can be trained via High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
* Running economy
    * It can continue improve over time (many years).
    * It consists of [^1]:
        * metabolic adaptations within the muscle such as increased mitochondria and oxidative enzymes 
        * the ability of the muscles to store and release elastic energy by increasing the stiffness of the muscles 
        * more efficient mechanics leading to less energy wasted on braking forces and excessive vertical oscillation
    * Can be trained via
        * HIIT 
        * Explosive (plyometrics) or maximal strength training  
        * intermittent hypoxia (Breath control?) 
* Endurance 
    * Both skeletal and cardiac muscle endurance
    * Typically, eccentric load is the most harmful to skeletal muscles during fatigue, which should be emphasized.
    * Can be trained via
        * eccentric strength training
        * Long run
* Fractional utilization - how much O2 can be utilized  
* Heat/altitude adaptation

### Summary

The following forms of exercises offers specific benefits for running:

1. Long run - Endurance
1. HIIT - VO2Max, running economy
1. Strength training - running economy, endurance
1. Plyometrics - running economy
1. Hill run - can be considered as a combination of HIIT (uphill) and Strength training (downhill, focusing on eccentric load)
