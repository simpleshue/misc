Stability is very important to running, since running basically is a singl-leg exercise for each step.

## 3-Level Test and Exercise

### Level 1

1-min single-leg stand, while the other leg's knee is lift high.

Pay attention to the following:

* Exert force from the soles of the feet
* Keep knees aligned with toes
* Keep pelvis from rotating
* Keep core stable

Some optional mutations:

1. Try on a soft or unstable surface
1. Hold some light weight
1. Tilt upper body (e.g., lean forward)

### Level 2

Once you are master Level 1, try single-leg quat and/or single-leg deadlift, with 10 repetitions.

Mutations:

1. Hold some light weight
1. Hand touch different locations on the floor
1. Try different weight

### Level 3

Try the following single leg exercise:

1. Jump up in place
1. Land with a single leg softly, with the knee bent.
1. Keep the balance for 2-3 seconds.

Mutations:

1. Jump up (step or box)
1. Continuous jumps (e.g. 5 steps forward)
1. Alternating leg while side jump.

## Dynamic Stability

Plank is a very effective way to increase core strength. However, it might not be that effective when maintaining the stability during movement.

[This article](https://archive.ph/eiDf7) mentioned 7 exercies that focus on dynamic stability, while also touches some important muscle groups (e.g., #7 Kettlebell Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift).
