## The Most Common Ones

There most common ones are:

1. Easy run
    * Typically at a conversational pace.
    * It can be considered as a way to maintain endurance level, allow recovery and improve efficiency.
1. Long run
    * For long distance runners, it is typicaly >= 90 mins. I prefer measure by duration rather than distance.
    * Typically done at a conversational pace.
    * It simulates body for better efficiency andd adaptation of long distances.
1. Hill run
    * Hill run put less stress on joints, while can still demand a lot of power output.
    * It is ideal before adding Tempo run into one's training.
    * Sometime, it can be mixed with Tempo or Intervals (there is no clear division).
1. Tempo
    * It is faster than the conversational pace. Often, it is at the speed you can sustain with some discomfort.
    * Maintain such a pace for a long duration, e.g., 20 mins to one hour.
    * It stresses runners by simulating a race-like situation. It focuses on runners' tolerance to high intensities.
1. Intervals
    * At a highest speed a runner can maintain for a short distance, or at the target speet for a race.
    * Repeated with rest in-between.
    * Short distance per repetition. E.g., 200m to 2000m.
    * Sometimme, people also sub-divide interval training into short and long intervals.
