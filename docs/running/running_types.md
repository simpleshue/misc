## The Most Common Ones

There most common ones are:

1. Easy run
    * Typically at a conversational pace.
    * It can be considered as a way to maintain endurance level, allow recovery and improve efficiency.
1. Long run
    * For long distance runners, it is typicaly >= 90 mins. I prefer measure by duration rather than distance.
    * Typically done at a conversational pace.
    * It simulates body for better efficiency andd adaptation of long distances.
1. Hill run
    * Uphill run put less stress on joints, while can still demand a lot of power output.
    * It is ideal before adding Tempo run into one's training.
    * Sometime, it can be mixed with Tempo or Intervals (there is no clear division).
1. Tempo
    * It is faster than the conversational pace. Often, it is at the speed you can sustain with some discomfort.
    * Maintain such a pace for a long duration, e.g., 20 mins to one hour.
    * It stresses runners by simulating a race-like situation. It focuses on runners' tolerance to high intensities.
1. Intervals
    * At a highest speed a runner can maintain for a short distance, or at the target speet for a race.
    * Repeated with rest in-between.
    * Short distance per repetition. E.g., 200m to 2000m.
    * Sometimme, people also sub-divide interval training into short and long intervals.

### Long run

* Pace - usually the pace is at conversational pace.
* Heart rate drift - if heart rate drifts upward while keeping the same pace/slope, it often means:
    1. under-fueled
    1. too much dehydration
    1. pace is too high

### Intervals

Interval training is considered to be an effective way to improve VO2Max and running economy.

#### Caution

Running in high speed introduces high risk of injury. So it is important to be caution about:

* Keep good forms and high cadence, and avoid over striding. Stop or reduce intensity if you find you can't sustain good forms or cadence.
* Concentrate on running lightly and efficiently
* Consider performing interval training on flat surface (e.g., a track), or even a stationary bike.

#### Progression

Ease into interval training with patience. Start with some striding, then fartlek.

Once you are confident enough, consider some hill intervals.

#### Example

1. Norwegian 4x4:
    * 4 repetitions of 4-min interval runs at 90-95% of max heart rate, with 30min recovery in between.
    * Often, one need to make very hard (maybe even all out pace) to reach the targetted heart rate in 60-90 seconds. Then effort can be reduced slightly to keep HR in range.
1. Tabata intervals:
    * 8 repetitions of 20-second interval runs at "all out" intensity, with 10-second recovery in between.
    * Can be modified to be a hill interval, at ~10% gradient. Consider a short hill which takes ~ 30 seconds at the fastest speed. Log downhill after each repetition.

### Hill run

#### Uphills

Uphill run generally put less stress on joints, so safer to perform. At the same time, it requires significant effort, hence is often a safe alternative to tempo or interval training.

One note is that while you are likely to land on forefoot due to the slope, it often puts more stress on the feet and calves. One should probably pay more attention to how to increase the stride using the glute muscles.

#### Downhills

It is generally believed that downhill  runs are riskier. It is likely due to longer air time, and hence heavier landing. Muscles are often taking eccentric load during downhill.

To train:

* pay special attention to increase or maintain high cadence.
* shorter steps
* try to land more on the mid to forefoot
* shift body slightly forward to stay perpendicular to the hill.
* spread arms for better balancing.
* overall, try to maintain smooth and efficient runs.
* start with shorter repeats to get used to the downhill runs, and gradually increase to 2 minutes.
* resist from practicing downhill runs too often (e.g., once every two weeks). It requires time for muscle to recover from hard downhill training.

### Tempo Debate

Tempo refers to continuous running at a relatively high speed (e.g., Lactate threshold speed) for a considerable long distance (longer than intervals). It sits between long run and interval runs, which puts stress in multiple trainable factors.

There is a lot of debate on effectiveness of tempo training. For professionals, extended tempo training means to sacrifice scarce resources (time, stress quote the body can take and recover from), which may lead to less-ideal performance improvement. On the other hand, polarized training approach is often preferred, where long run and HIIT are used as the main training types. The argument for polarized training is:

1. Long run at easy pace allow for fast recovery, while specifically targeted on training for endurance (e.g., higher volume).
1. HIIT also specifically targets running economy, and puts less stress on the body. It also allows the athletes to training more at the higher intensity.

For beginners though, tempo still offers training benefit. But it may also increase the risk of injuery. To make an analogy, tempo training is like those complex weight-lifting workout, which engages many muscle groups. While you can archieve many things at once, none of the muscles groups receives strong stimulus. While the weight increases, some weak-link may be put on too much stress, leading to injury. While some more specific exercise can be better controlled to avoid injury.
